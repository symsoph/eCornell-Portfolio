Unit 8
- Final Assignment - Define ML Problem and Build Own Model(s)

## Background

For the last assignment as part of the Intro to Machine Learning Course provided by the Break Through Tech program, I was tasked to define my own ML problem utilized course-approved datasets.  

Initially, I was inspired by our `Neural Network Sentiment Analysis` notebook, so I wanted to create a neural network that could predict the author based on a dataset of book reviews.  The bookReviews dataset had to be reoganized and cleaned for proper author and book columns.  I realized this was time-consuming. I had trouble verifying if a reader was referring to a book series or if they even mentioned a book title.  Essentially, I had no idea which authors and which books they were referring to.  

I had to pivot, so I changed my plan and defined a new problem: to predict if an individual's income was greater than 50k, given a variety of personal data from the USA census.  

## Viewing the Project

In the **Unit 8 folder**, `Lab_DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb` contains my process and analysis, or free feel to view the `pdf` version under a similar name. 

You can `clone` this repo to run the notebook yourself to see the models,
